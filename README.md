The original data set contains over 1 million data points with 21 variables related to airport operations.  The response variable of interest is arrival delays and we were interested in building a model from the data that would be useful in predicting arrival delays based on the other variables, which have information on time and of departures and arrivals, airline carriers, origin and destination airports, and departure delays. We subset the data to only include flights departing from George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and this left us with 29,070 data points. We were looking to determine which variables had the most significant impact on arrival delays and also answering a few research questions such as which variables best explain the model? Which model best explains the data? How good is the fit of our data?
